# Designing Interfaces for Live Performance 2022
Examples from Designing Interfaces for Live Performance Class IMA NYU 2022

## From Class 03-23-2022

Covering: CHOP Exports, Noise, Panel, Pattern, Math, Feedback, and, Composite

We exported many CHOPS and used Math to map different values to different parameters. We moved a circle with the mouse, noise, and patterns and got an intro into Compositing
